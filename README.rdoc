A Rails app to manage multiple stock portfolios. 

The app implements the Yahoo Finance API to look up real-time stock data. 
After signing up, users can create as many portfolios as they want and add 
as many stocks to these portfolios as desired. 

An additional feature is that when viewing a portfolio, a Yahoo Finance news
API pulls in the 10 most recently published news stories related to the companies
in the portfolio being viewed.
